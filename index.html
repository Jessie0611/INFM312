            Typically an ID field is an integer type. This allows for faster retrieval of data, epically when dealing with millions of records. 
            So Customer Number would be in the form of 1, 2, 3 etc. Deleting the Boat name in the Owners table and 
            adding a Boat ID column there and then adding a BoatID field in the Boats table is the more standard way of 
            dealing with this. I know the textbook did use text as a ID field but what if there were multiple owners 
            with the name of Susan Smith?
